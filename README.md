# Curve trade opportunities based on FOMC minutes
The project aims to identify curve trade opportunities on U.S. Treasuries. 

To forecast the short end of the curve (i.e. 2Y Treasury yields), FOMC minutes senetiments were analyzed given the short end is very sensitive to Fed Fund rate adjustments. 

Whereas for the long end (i.e. 10Y-30Y Treasury yields), the further out we go on the yield curve, the less casual impact there is using just sentiment to explain the curve. 

Hence, going forward the project plans to monitor macroeconomic indicators such as demand and supply of bonds; inflation expectations, 
inflation expectations being the second order impact of CPI/ NFP/ PCE.
