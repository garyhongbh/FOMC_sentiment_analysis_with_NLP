The project aims to identify curve trade opportunities on U.S. Treasuries with NLP. 
To forecast the short end of the curve (i.e. 2Y Treasury yields), FOMC minutes senetiments were analyzed given the short end is very sensitive to Fed Fund rate adjustments. 
Whereas for the long end (i.e. 10Y-30Y Treasury yields), the further out we go on the yield curve, the less casual impact there is using just sentiment to explain the curve. 
Hence, going forward the project plans to monitor macroeconomic indicators such as demand and supply of bonds; inflation expectations, 
inflation expectations being the second order impact of CPI/ NFP/ PCE. Using forecasted yield spread derived from FOMC meeting sentiments and macro data, 
the project aims to predict yield spreads to come up with curve trade strategies to make profits.
